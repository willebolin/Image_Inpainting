# Image Inpainting 
This repository is created for the Stanford course CS230, "Deep Learning".

# Project
The project is to build an agent who can repaint missing parts of pictures. Please see https://www.dropbox.com/s/89f0iypjhimpng9/CS230_final.pdf?dl=0 for the results writeup.

# Method
The method we propose is comnbination of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and partial convlution that was developed by NVIDIA (as seen here: https://github.com/NVIDIA/partialconv).
